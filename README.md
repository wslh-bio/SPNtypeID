### Using the workflow
The pipeline is designed to start from raw, paired-end Illumina reads. Start the pipeline using:
```
nextflow run SPNtypeID/main.nf --input [path-to-samplesheet] --outdir [path-to-outdir] --ntc_regex [what-expression-to-look-for-in-ntcs] --runname [what-to-call-run] -profile [docker,singularity,aws]
```

or from github using:
```
nextflow run wslh-bio/SPNtypeID -r [version] --input [path-to-samplesheet] --outdir [path-to-outdir] -ntc_regex [what-expression-to-look-for-in-ntcs] --runname [what-to-call-run] -profile [docker,singularity,aws]
```

You can also test the pipeline with example data using `-profile test` or `-profile test_full`:
```
nextflow run SPNtypeID/main.nf --outdir [path-to-outdir] -profile test[_full],[docker,singularity]
```

### Input
SPNTypeID's inputs are paired Illumina FASTQ files for each sample and a comma separated sample sheet containing the sample name, the path to the forward reads file, and the path to the reverse reads file for each sample. A sample sheet can be created using the [fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py](https://github.com/wslh-bio/SPNtypeID/blob/main/bin/fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py) script or by hand.  An example of the sample sheet's format can be seen in the table below and found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wslh-bio/SPNtypeID/main/samplesheets/workflow_test.csv).

| sample  | fastq_1 | fastq_2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| sample_name  | /path/to/sample_name_R1.fastq.gz | /path/to/sample_name_R2.fastq.gz |

### Parameters
SPNTypeID's main parameters and their defaults are shown in the table below:
| Parameter  | Parameter description and default |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| contaminants  | Path to fasta of contaminants for removal, defaults to BBDuk's adapters fasta |
| maxcontigs | Set the maximum number of contigs allowed in an assembly (default: 300) |
| maxpctother  | Sets the maximum percentage of reads from other organisms (default: 1.0) |
| minavgreadq | Sets the minimum average read quality score (default: 30) |
| mincoverage | Sets the minimum coverage (default: 40) |
| minlength | Minimum read length for trimming (default: 10) |
| minpctspn | Sets the minimum percentage of reads that must be S. pneumoniae (default: 60.0) |
| minpctstrep | Sets the minimum percentage of reads that must be Streptococcus (default: 80.0) |
| ntc_regex | Regex pattern for identifying no template control (NTC) files. This is a mandatory parameter if a run has an NTC. (default: null) |
| qualitytrimscore | Sets the BBDuk trimming quality score value (default: 10) |
| trimdirection | Sets the BBDuk trimming direction (default: 'lr') |

#### Read trimming and quality assessment
Read repair, trimming, and cleaning are performed using [BBtools v38.76](https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) to repair fastqs with mismatched read numbers, trim reads of low quality bases, and remove PhiX contamination. Then [FastQC v0.11.8](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is used assess the quality of the raw and cleaned reads. [Bioawk v1.0](https://github.com/lh3/bioawk) is used to calculate the mean and median quality of the cleaned reads.

#### Genome assembly
Assembly of the cleaned and trimmed reads is performed using [Shovill v1.1.0](https://github.com/tseemann/shovill).

#### Genome assembly quality assessment
Quality assessment of the assemblies is performed using [QUAST v5.0.2](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast).

#### Genome coverage quality assessment
Mean and median genome coverage is determined by mapping the cleaned reads back their the assembly using [BWA v0.7.17-r1188](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) and calculating depth using [Samtools v1.10](http://www.htslib.org/).

#### Genome length assessment
Genome length is assessed by comparing the expected *S. pneumoniae* genome length to the observed genome length and calculating a Z score. These statistics (which can be found [here](/assets/databases/NCBI_Assembly_stats_20240124.txt) were obtained from the [PHoeNIx](https://github.com/CDCgov/phoenix) pipeline, which calculated them from 9266 publicly available *S. pneumoniae* genomes.

#### Contamination detection
Contamination is detected by classifying reads using [Kraken v1.0.0](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/).

#### Serotyping
Serotyping is performed using [SeroBA v2.0.4](https://github.com/GlobalPneumoSeq/seroba).
